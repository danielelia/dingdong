        sexual health on campus by making condom access easier.

    <string name="menu_about_us">\tWe built this app for our Computer Science Senior Conference project.
        This year\'s topic is Mobile Health and we wanted our project to be about something that\'s
        relevant for most of us - sex in college. We want to research whether or not this service
        improves access to condoms on campus and individuals\' sexual practices and health.

        \n\tThis app works by allowing you to place an order during the hours that the app is open
        this following week. In order to protect anonymity, we are not asking for or storing any
        personally identifiable data (eg. phone numbers, emails). We are only collecting data from
        the orders placed and responses to our
        day-after surveys.

        \n\tThanks for your help! - Winnie, Awjin, Daniel</string>

    <string name="survey_explanation">Thank you very much for using our service! In order to better understand how useful this service was to you
    and whether it is worth developing further, we would ask you to take a few moments to fill out the below survey.
    As always, it is completely anonymous and will only be used for evaluation in terms of our research project.\n
    Thanks again,\nAwjin, Winnie and Daniel</string>
